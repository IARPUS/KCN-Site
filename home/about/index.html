				<h1>This is USC Korean Culture Night</h1>
				<p>We are a student-run organization at University Southern California campus that presents an annual
					production
					to celebrate Korean and Korean-American culture through the integration of artistic elements like theatre,
					music, and dance.<br /></p>
				<p>Our rich Korean culture – our diverse and delicious food, our rising K-Pop culture, our deep history, our
					advancements with technology – is what our staff is dedicated to spreading and sharing with the USC and Los
					Angeles community.</p>
				<p>Since the first Korean Culture Night held at USC in 2012, we have consistently invited not only the USC
					community to our production, but also the surrounding local Los Angeles community to experience Korean and
					Korean-American culture.
